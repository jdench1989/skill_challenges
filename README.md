This project relates to the Golden Square Principles module of teh Makers Academy software development bootcamp. 

The objectives of this module are:

    Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
    Learn to break programs up into classes.
    Learn to debug your programs.
    Learn to build software as a pair.
    Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.

Specifically, thse exercises ar from the second phase of the module: Skill challenges. 

The focus of this phase is to use TDD principles to design a program of multiple classes using pair programming techniques. Each file relates to specific examples, exercises, or challenges within the module with associated test files where relevant. 

The module takes place within the scope of designing and constructing a personal diary system.
