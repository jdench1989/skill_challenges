# Set a timer for 10 minutes.

# Your challenge is to debug the program below before the timer goes off. 
# When you fix the program or the timer goes off, move on to the next exercise.

def say_hello(name):
    return f"hello {name}"

# original was missing the f at start of f"hello {name}"

# Intended output:
