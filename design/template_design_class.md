{{PROBLEM}} Class Design Recipe
Copy this into a recipe.md in your project and fill it out.

1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

2. Design the Class Interface
Include the initializer, public properties, and public methods with all parameters, return values, and side-effects.

# EXAMPLE

class Reminder:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   name: string

    def __init__(self, name):
        # Parameters:
        #   name: string
        # Side effects:
        #   Sets the name property of the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def remind_me_to(self, task):
        # Parameters:
        #   task: string representing a single task
        # Returns:
        #   Nothing
        # Side-effects
        #   Saves the task to the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def remind(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A string reminding the user to do the task
        # Side-effects:
        #   Throws an exception if no task is set
        pass # No code here yet
3. Create Examples as Tests
Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations.

# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a name and a task
#remind reminds the user to do the task
"""
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("Walk the dog")
reminder.remind() # => "Walk the dog, Kay!"

"""
Given a name and no task
#remind raises an exception
"""
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind() # raises an error with the message "No task set."

"""
Given a name and an empty task
#remind still reminds the user to do the task, even though it looks odd
"""
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("")
reminder.remind() # => ", Kay!"
Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.

4. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
